# Binary Calculator - Cloud Computing

Welcome to the **Binary Calculator - Cloud Computing** project! This repository contains a cloud-based binary calculator designed to perform various binary operations with speed and efficiency. The project leverages cloud computing principles to ensure scalability, reliability, and seamless user experience. This project was created for the purpose of my cloud computing module at university, which required me to write a report on cloud computing and create a simple service app and cleint app to interact with the service while hosting the service, for the hosting I chose microsoft azure's web service app.
